The main area of the page varies between the pages. ###Home page <img src="images/homePage.jpg" alt="wireframe diagram - home page" /> Basic home page with popular items or staff suggestions displayed to give customers ideas of books to borrow. ###About page <img src="images/about.jpg" alt="wireframe diagram - about page" /> The about page will have text detailing services available on the website. ###Login page <img src="images/loginPage.jpg" alt="wireframe diagram - login page" /> Login page with textboxes for user input of username and password and a login (submit) button. ###Login page for staff <img src="images/loginPageStaff.jpg" alt="wireframe diagram - Staff login page" /> Login page with textboxes as above and a warning banner to alert non-staff users that login is restricted. ###Search page <img src="images/search.jpg" alt="wireframe diagram - search page" /> Search page with textboxes for user input of title, author or keyword.

The basic structure of the database is built on three tables. These are a table of users, a table of books and a table of loans. ###User table The user table contains details of staff and customers. Both are in the same table as there are only a few entries in this test system. The id is auto-incremented in this table, however in a real-world situation the id would be a staff member number or membership number for customers.<br />| id | username | firstname | lastname | address | email | password | role | | :----- | :-------- | :-------- | :------- | :--------- | :------ | :------- | :--- | | 1 | fred | Fred | Smith | My address | myEmail | password | staff | ###Book table The book table contains details of the books in the library. The id is the ISBN, which is a unique identifier for a particular publication of a work by an author (Coyle, 2015). The date is the year of publication for this particular publication. Books have been identified by various catagories. The description is a short piece of text giving a basic idea of what the book is about. | isbn | title | author | publisher | date | catagory | description | | :-------- | :--------- | :---------- | :--------------- | :--- | :------- | :---------- | | 151008116 | Life of Pi | Yann Martel | Houghton Mifflin | 2002 | fiction | Sample text | ###Loans table The loans table is a table of loans with an auto-incremented loanId. Each loan has a customer id and a book id, the date the book was taken out and the date it will be due back. | loanId | userId | bookId | dateOut | dateDueBack | | :----- | :----- | :-------- | :--------- | :---------- | | 1 | 3 | 857381113 | 2017-03-22 | 2017-04-20 |</p>
