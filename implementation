Implementation
This project is implemented using a combination of PHP as the middleware with HTML providing the user interface client side and MySql as the database language.  HTML templates use the Twig templating system for ease of design.  The PHP code is implemented using Symfony, which aids in designing routing and the separation of different types of functions into separate classes.  This is useful for code reuse and debugging.  Symfony provides access to various built-in services and also the ability to design services and tie them into the current project where appropriate.
