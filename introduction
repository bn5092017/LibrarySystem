#Introduction
##Objectives
This project aims to design a user-friendly system to allow customer and staff users to access information on library materials held, both on site and online.
##Scope
The library information system will keep a record of staff and customer details.  It will also keep a record of the books in the library and track which books are on loan to which customers.  It will allow customers to search the library catalog, and renew books that they have out on loan.  It is not intended to be a full information management system for a library as it does not track orders and invoices that the library may generate in ordering stock.
##Overview
Libraries require cataloguing systems to keep track of the library inventory from the early hand-written records to modern computerised database systems.  Libraries in this information-driven age need to make use of currently available technologies to provide the best service to customers.  Library users today are increasingly technology literate (Clehane and O'Brien, 2015) and these users have an expectation of access to information via the web or downloadable apps.  The expansion of library holdings into various types of media including music, DVD and eBooks gives rise to the question of how to catalogue these items for ease of searching.  Collaborations between various libraries would be better facilitated if the tools in use were easy to integrate, being based on similar platforms and using the same terminology (Stack, 2015).  Further advances can be made into integrated information management and cataloguing systems for libraries, providing new or enhanced services for customers and staff.
