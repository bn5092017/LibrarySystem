Introduction
Libraries require cataloguing systems to keep track of the library inventory
from the early hand-written records to modern computerised database systems.
Libraries in this information-driven age need to make use of currently available
technologies to provide the best service to customers.  Library users today are
increasingly technology literate (Clehane and O'Brien, 2015) and these users
have an expectation of access to information via the web or downloadable apps.
The expansion of library holdings into various types of media including music,
DVD and eBooks gives rise to the question of how to catalogue these items for
ease of searching.  Collaborations between various libraries would be better
facilitated if the tools in use were easy to integrate, being based on similar
platforms and using the same terminology (Stack, 2015).  Further advances can be
made into integrated information management and cataloguing systems for libraries,
providing new of enhanced services for customers and staff.  This project aims
to design user-friendly customer and staff interfaces that address the need to
access information on library materials held.
