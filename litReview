##Library cataloguing and technology
Library information systems catalogue the inventory of library items held.  This can include various materials, such as books, periodicals, academic papers, music, video, and e-books.  They can also be used to track items out on loan, items on order, and items requested by customers or other institutions.  Some information systems may also track orders and invoices.  Access to a database of customers and of staff could also form part of the same system.
Management of information is an essential part of library maintenance.  It is important for libraries to be aware of what they own as well as what is available to them when considering things like patron driven acquisition.  Patron driven acquisition involves basing stock ordering decisions on customer requests for particular items (Quigley, 2014).  Increasing demand for availability of online information that spans more than just the local library holdings has driven a need for systems where information can be easily exchanged between institutions.  This has seen libraries move towards the integration of different library systems and greater cooperation between libraries (Clehane and O'Brien, 2015).  The use of one system for all libraries would enable an easy exchange of data, however a one-size-fits-all system may not suit the various needs of the libraries involved.  In order to meet the needs of individual libraries, customisable software could be used, though this would require that library staff had sufficient IT skills to customise the software for their individual library's needs. (Stack, 2015).
Library users
Libraries exist to provide a service to their customers.  Good communication between library users and libraries can be used to help enhance the user experience (Vleeschouwer et al, 2014).  Front-line staff are a valuable resource when considering the needs and wants of the customer as they see them face-to-face.  They can provide feedback on the impact on the customer of any changes made and can help when evaluating user requirements (Hanrahan, 2015).  It is therefore important that library staff keep themselves up-to-date on available technologies in order to provide the best service to customers (O'Sullivan, 2015).  Social media is one method that can be used by libraries to connect with their customers (McGuinness, 2014).  Some libraries use facebook and twitter accounts to keep their customers up-to-date with library events and services.  Online library information systems are currently available from various libraries and library groups, including many universities and educational institutes and Libraries Ireland.
##Libraries Ireland
Libraries Ireland uses a combination of HTML5, CSS and Javascript to provide interactive online services such as Eâ€“Learning Courses, Digital Magazines, Online Newspapers and lending E-books and E-audio books via the Borrow Box service.
##Manchester University library
Manchester University library provides a postal service for distance learning students to make it easier for students off- campus to access library materials.  A customer must be a registered student to avail of this service.
