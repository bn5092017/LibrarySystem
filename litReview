##PHP
PHP is a server-side programming language which integrates easily with both MySQL and HTML to provide websites that can change with user input and work with large amounts of data (Nixon, 2015; php.net).  PHP forms the middle-ground between the user interface and the data held in the database.  PHP can be used with all major operating systems and web browsers and with many databases (php.net).
