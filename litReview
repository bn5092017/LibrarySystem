##Library cataloguing and technologies
Social media can be used by libraries to connect with their customers (McGuinness, 2014).  It is important for libraries to be aware of what they own as well as what is available to them when considering things like patron driven acquisition (Quigley, 2014).  Library staff need to keep themselves up-to-date on available technologies in order to provide the best service to customers (O'Sullivan, 2015).  Front-line staff are a valuable resource when considering the needs and wants of the customer as they see them face-to-face.  They can provide feedback on the impact on the customer of any changes made and can help when evaluating user requirements (Hanrahan, 2015).
##PHP
PHP is a server-side programming language which integrates easily with both MySQL and HTML to provide websites that can change with user input and work with large amounts of data (Nixon, 2015; php.net).  PHP forms the middle-ground between the user interface and the data held in the database.  PHP can be used with all major operating systems and web browsers and with many databases (php.net).
Both PHP and Java can be used as a middle-ground between the client-side GUI and the server-side data (Trent et al, 2008, Adebukola and Kazeem, 2014).  Both have similar capabilities and there is little to choose between them (Trent et al, 2008).  Part of the popularity of PHP is that it is free to use (Adebukola and Kazeem, 2014).
PHP can be used to output HTML (Nixon, 2015).  PHP is less strict with formatting than other languages (Nixon, 2015).  PHP supports object oriented programming.  Using OOP and encapsulating the data so that the code itself cannot be directly accessed is more secure and makes it more simple to update code, simply replace the old class with a new class (Nixon, 2015).
