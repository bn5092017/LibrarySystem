##Library cataloguing and technologies
Social media can be used by libraries to connect with their customers (McGuinness, 2014).  It is important for libraries to be aware of what they own as well as what is available to them when considering things like patron driven acquisition (Quigley, 2014).  Library staff need to keep themselves up-to-date on available technologies in order to provide the best service to customers (O'Sullivan, 2015).  Front-line staff are a valuable resource when considering the needs and wants of the customer as they see them face-to-face.  They can provide feedback on the impact on the customer of any changes made and can help when evaluating user requirements (Hanrahan, 2015).  Good communication between library users and llibraries can be used to help enhance the user experience (Vleeschouwer et al, 2014).  Libraries are moving towards integration of different library systems and enhanced cooperation between libraries (Clehane and O'Brien, 2015).  In order to meet the needs of individual libraries, customisable software could be used, though this would require that library staff were sufficiently proficient in IT skills (Stack, 2015).  Online library information systems are currently available from various libraries and library groups.
